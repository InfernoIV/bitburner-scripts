General
  * Know what the code block must perform
  * Maintain naming conventions which are uniform throughout.
  * Indicate a brief description of what a variable is for (reference to commenting)
  * Correct errors as they occur.
  * Keep your code simple
  * Design code with scalability and reuse in mind.
  * Prevent "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) code

Variables
  * Use snake case for naming conventions
  * Add GLOBAL if the variable is global (try to limit as much as possible)
  * Use variables when value is used more than 1 time
  * only use objects when:
    * Specific checks are done every time
    * used multiple times

Functions
  * Keep all functions in 1 file
   * Main purpose is to create a clear calculation for RAM (visible from within bitburner, doesn't require extra steps)
   * Scope is clear (only for specific file)
   * Findability since all functions are in the same file
